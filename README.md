# OpenWeather

Use the OpenWeather API call http://openweathermap.org/forecast5 to retrieve data for displaying weather forecast by every 3 hours for upcoming 5 days.

Present data in visual structure, where every day represents a row and every 3 hour weather forecast represents a cell in a row.

Each row should clearly show date and each cell in the row should clearly show temperature and time of the day.  Present city/town/postcode as well, whatever applicable.
